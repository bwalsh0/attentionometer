## Mobile Push Notifications through Telegram Bot API & Node.js
If you're not my SO this will have no use to you

## What it does
Website button click -> Notification on phone

Created Telegram Bot to poll and detect webpage actions and send them to a private user channel through Telegram X. WebHook and Node.js server implemented with maximum 3 HTTPS connections. Requires Bot Token and Telegram Chat ID. Basically an overglorified pager system that deeply insults the versatility of the Telegram Bot API.
